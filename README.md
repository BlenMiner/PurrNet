PurrNet is our attempt at the purrfect networking solution... It's a 100% free Unity Networking solution with no pro or premium version, and no features locked behind a pay-gate.
You can use it to release, and we ask nothing in return! Read the Unique to PurrNet section to see what we offer above other solutions!
